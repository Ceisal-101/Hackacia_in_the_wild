        "content": "The image shows a chessboard from a top-down perspective, with each square labeled from a-h horizontally and 1-8 vertically. The board contains a mix of white and black pieces in various positions. On the right side of the image, there is a set of instructions titled \"How to Solve Chess Puzzles,\" outlining an eight-step process to evaluate and solve chess positions. The steps include: \n\n1. Do a Quick Evaluation of the Position\n2. Determine the Likely Objective\n3. Consider Your Opponent's Last Move\n4. Identify Possible Targets and Motifs\n5. Examine Moves That Smite\n6. Settle on Your Chosen Move\n7. Compare Your Answer With the Solution\n8. Study the Solution to the Puzzle\n\nBelow this list, there's a quote attributed to Cecil Purdy: \"Examine moves that smite! A good eye for smites is far more important than a knowledge of strategical principles!\" The website \"chessfox.com\" is indicated at the bottom of the instructions. The entire image has a contrasting color scheme emphasizing the strategic nature of the game.",
